# Credit Scoring Machine Learning Model
This repository contains a solution to Kaggle Competition problem (Credit Scoring Classification)<br/>


## To perform data analysis, I’ve used such tools as:
R programming language and several modules for data analysis (dplyr), tools for plotting (highcharter,plotly), model creation (stats).<br/>
Python programming language as a platform for running Tensorflow machine learning library<br/>
For studying these libraries I’ve used Tensorflow wiki, R documentation from the links below:<br/>
#### * https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/
#### * https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2

The results obtained:
Logistic Regression - 65%
Neural Network - 70%.
